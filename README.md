# Project Name: Vikingbot

Vikingbot is a small motor-driven robot utilizing Python, ROS (in the future), and OpenCV to perform different applications
  
# Project Goals

Facial Recognition
- Vikingbot rotates to align itself with faces it detects in front [done]
Gesture Recognition
- Vikingbot will nod its head when it sees a smile [done]
Color Tracking
- Vikingbot will rotate and follow an orange ball when it is detected [done]
IR Sensors
- Vikingbot will prevent itself from crashing by using IR sensors to detect distance from obstacles
